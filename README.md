Spoiler Revealer
================

Wanting to learn a bit more JQuery, so this is me creating a small spoiler revealer with JQuery.

As a Game of Thrones enthusiast,
So I'm not exposed to any upsetting spoilers while I read this page,
I would like to have all spoilers hidden from me.

As someone who doesn't watch Game of Thrones but who likes to read what's going on,
So I can catch up with the latest plot,
I would like to be given the choice to view spoilers.

* When page is loaded, keep spoilers (already hardcoded in the page) hidden.
* Viewer has to click on a button to show all the spoilers.
